Search Functionality:

Allow users to enter search queries for hymns. Make the search intuitive and provide suggestions as the user types (autocomplete).
Detailed Hymn Information:

Display detailed information for each hymn, such as title, author, hymn number, and lyrics. Make sure to format the lyrics in a readable and user-friendly way.
Filtering Options:

Implement filtering options to allow users to refine their search based on criteria like hymn type (e.g., traditional, contemporary), author, hymnbook, or category.
Pagination or Infinite Scrolling:

If the Hymnary API returns a large number of results, implement pagination or infinite scrolling to improve user experience and prevent overwhelming the user with too much information at once.
Responsive Design:

Ensure your application looks and functions well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Loading Indicators:

Implement loading indicators to provide feedback to users when the application is fetching data from the API. This helps manage user expectations and provides a better experience.
Error Handling:

Handle errors gracefully and display friendly error messages to users if something goes wrong with the API requests.
Bookmark or Save Feature:

Allow users to bookmark or save their favorite hymns for quick access in the future. You can use local storage or a backend server to store this information.
Shareable Links:

Provide shareable links for specific hymns or search results. This can be achieved by updating the URL with the current state of the application, enabling users to share a link to a particular hymn or search query.
User Feedback and Notifications:

Implement feedback mechanisms to notify users when an action is successful or if an error occurs. This could include success messages, error alerts, or toasts.
Integration with External APIs:

Consider integrating additional APIs to enhance the user experience, such as incorporating audio versions of hymns or related content.
Aesthetic Design:

Design the user interface to be visually appealing and easy to navigate. Consider using CSS frameworks or styling libraries to enhance the aesthetics.
